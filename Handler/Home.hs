-- This seems to be a way to show relationships that can't be put into type signatures.

-- We could find a sane and sound way to generate these functions. They happen when there is a 
-- model in the DB that represents a relationship between other tables. Really, this
-- function should only return true if there is some Author object where its author Id
-- and its Paper id are equal to the input UserId and Paper. This will also be very
-- expensive to do, since we will have to make a DB call for each paper.
-- refinement reflection:
-- provide a proof that selectList would give us true iff isAuthor holds.
